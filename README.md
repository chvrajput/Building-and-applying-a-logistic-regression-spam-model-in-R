Evaluating Classification model
A classification model places examples into two or more categories. The most common measure of classifier quality is accuracy and the incredible tool called the confusion matrix.So here I'm taking an example of classifying email into spam(email we in no way want) and non-spam(email we want). Each row of this dataset is a set of features measured for a specific email and an additional column telling whether the email was spam (unwanted) or non-spam(wanted). we'll quickly build a spam classification model so wh have results to evaluate.

Load the spam data by attach dataset by using attach(spam) or data(spam). Second step to split the data into training and testing data. Now its time to building and applying a logistic regression spam model.Evaluate the model by using our increadible tool (confusion matrix to evaluate model) and accuracy.
